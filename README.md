**# VaahanGURUJI**
VaahanGURUJI is a Car Price Predictor Based on Machine Learning is an innovative solution designed to address the challenges of accurately estimating a car's resale value. 

In the dynamic automotive market, determining the fair price of a car can be complex due to numerous factors such as mileage, fuel type, age, and transmission, which often make manual estimations unreliable. This project leverages the power of machine learning to analyze historical car data and predict resale prices with precision. By utilizing features like fuel type, kilometers driven, and current price, the system provides data-driven insights that empower both buyers and sellersto make informed decisions. 

The need for such a tool arises from the inconsistencies and biases in traditional car valuation methods, which often lead to disagreements and undervaluations.
With its user-friendly graphical interface, the predictor simplifies the process, ensuring transparency and fairness in car pricing. This project showcases the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world problems and highlights its potential to revolutionize how we evaluate assets in everyday life.

  ðŸ”¹Interactive Visuals: Embedded Matplotlib graphs directly in the application.

  

**Technologies Used:-**

  ðŸ”¹Programming Language: Python
  
  ðŸ”¹GUI Framework: Tkinter with ttkthemes
  
  ðŸ”¹Machine Learning Model: Linear Regression (via scikit-learn)
  
  ðŸ”¹Visualization: Matplotlib
  

**Usage:-**

Run the application: python app.py
The GUI window will open. 
Follow these steps:

  â–¸Select a car model from the dropdown menu.
  
  â–¸Click on the "Predict Details" button.
  
  â–¸View the predicted price and other details.
  
  â–¸Explore the depreciation graph for the selected car.
  

**Dataset:-**

The application uses a dataset of car details including:

ðŸ”¹Car name

ðŸ”¹Selling price

ðŸ”¹Present price

ðŸ”¹Kms driven

ðŸ”¹Fuel type

ðŸ”¹Seller type

ðŸ”¹Transmission type

ðŸ”¹Age of the car


The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical data and scale numerical features for better predictions.
